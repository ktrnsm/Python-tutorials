2023-04-10,"@SFDamnPodcast @ppv_tahoe I just left a similar comment. San Fran &amp; the Bay Area was such a cool place in the 80’s-90’s. It’s a different planet now. I was excited to take my husband, but I hadn’t been in some time. I was warned, but I thought it was hyperbole. Let’s just say he never wanted to go back."
2023-04-10,"@ShellenbergerMD Some of my best memories are stuck in 80’s-20’s San Fran. It was eclectic, had character, a unique essence to it. No city was quite like it. To see such suffering...The death of these people &amp; the death of this city seem to reflect the downward spiral of our country."

2023-04-07,@andrewtpalmer Fokking hell that was funny. You earned my follow🤣.
2023-04-07,"@KayFabe2022 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD All great tips. It’s just shocking &amp; really frustrating to see how many are not just sheep/sleep walking, but how confident they are in their tunnel vision. I get it, I used to think some of the same things. It’s like leaving a cult."
2023-04-07,"@KayFabe2022 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD A net positive for sure! I’m grateful he exposed it. 

Q is, how will we discern the truth once these think tanks &amp; their tools take more control? Will we know our own minds? If so, how 2 convince others? Propaganda depends on us not recognizing it &amp; being shamed into silence."
2023-04-07,"@KayFabe2022 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD Yes, I agree on all accounts. You can’t be on that level &amp; not work w/ ppl of varying degrees of shade. But once you start marinating in the same dish, it’s impossible not to pick up (@ last some)of that flavor, no matter how well intentioned."
2023-04-07,"@KayFabe2022 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD Personally, $ like many others, I think the larger story was the fact that Medhi didn’t even acknowledge that the Twitter files exposed the fact that we’re living the same reality we thought the Soviets experienced. This is a dark, uncomfortable reality to say the least."
2023-04-07,"@KayFabe2022 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD I trust &amp; respect Matt, he’s 1 of the few. It’s human nature and fallibility that I don’t have blind trust in.

2023-04-06,"@Duckdude1973 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD I guess what I mean is that human nature, power, &amp; states work the same @ the end of the day. We’re all looking for a hero, but no one person or thing can deliver in full. We all have a master (s) in some form or another. I will say this though, when he 1st acquired Twitter…"
2023-04-06,"@Duckdude1973 @TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD I do agree w/you. He has done a great service to us all. He delivered us from the jaws of a beast we didn’t fully realize we were in, but there are limits to everything, for everyone, even him. You can’t be part of a system &amp; outside of it @ the same time."
2023-04-06,"@andrewtpalmer @KimIversenShow I agree with you there.  I just expressed the same sentiment in a comment about a different topic. We have freedom up to a point, but once that freedom threatens real power, it starts to disappear. Some governments make it obvious, others are better at hiding it."
2023-04-06,"@TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD I love the work Matt, Glenn, &amp; Michael do, but you can’t trust anyone fully. Everyone has their own interests &amp; biases, &amp; we’re all in the game. ⬅️,➡️, &amp; center, US empire or emerging BRICS. Ppl are looking for a savior, but human nature &amp; states work the same in the end."
2023-04-06,"@TheLastMohicans @ShellenbergerMD When Elon 1st bought Twitter &amp; ppl said he was a free speech hero, I said no way. He will push against it to a point, but that spear will dull when/if it threatens real interests. A guy who works w/ government, has contracts w/it, receives subsidies &amp; a clearance? No way."

2023-04-06,@sz_duras @KenjiSiratori I’d add Orhan Pamuk’s ‘My Name Is Red’. A book about one of the Ottoman book arts: miniature. The works were not signed by the painters nor created by one person. A depersonalised art of technical image reproduction. Pamuk uses miniatures to trace a murder case.
